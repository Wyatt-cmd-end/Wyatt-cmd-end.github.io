                <p class="p5">How it all began.</p>
                <p class="p6">This company started very small with just me and my two other friends Richard and Xiao Feng. At the beginning of our company our sales were very slow and people prefered bigger wallet companies than us. Not only that making these wallets in mass production was very hard for me and my team,so Richard created an idea to make a replicating fusion machine,but we didn't have the parts for it ,so Xiao Feng made a scam call center in India to make money to buy the parts for the machine. Some of the parts were not listed and we had to go to the black market held in Russia to buy reactor parts,very Radioactive elements, and compounds to build it. Me and the team ended up getting hunted down by the KGB in Russia but we ended up getting back into America with the Illegal components. We built the machine and it worked very well until Xiao Feng played CS:GO next to the Machine making the power grid short circuit and it broke down. But now we have 5 billion wallets to sell. Thanks you for reading. Skibity.</p>
